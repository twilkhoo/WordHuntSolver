Approach 1:

Backtrack, build all possible words (12029640), and then look up
each of these words in the dictionary.





Approach 2:
Build a trie of all english words once, then recursively backtrack.
The advantage that this has is that we can break early in the backtracking.
E.g. if we know there is no valid word starting with abcd, we won't check abcd____...
This is because the trie will indicate no more words, so we can end the current search and backtrack from the previous spot.
